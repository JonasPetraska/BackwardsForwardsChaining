# Backwards and forwards chaining algorithms
Artificial intelligence course backwards and forwards chaining algorithms implementation program. 

Vilnius University, 2020

# Algorithm
Classical artificial intelligence algorithms: backwards and forwards chaining

# Logging
Algorithm is enhanced with advanced logging and tracing in every step.

# Input
Program requires files as input.

Samples can be found in `Samples/input` folder.

# Tests
Taken from https://klevas.mif.vu.lt/~cyras/AI/ai-cyras.pdf pages `78-82`.

These tests can be used to check validity of the algorithm results.
